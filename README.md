This repository contains a modified version of the Huggingface library example for the question answering task. 
It was a group project for the Deep Learning course offered at HEC Montreal. We we reviewed state-of-the-art transformer models for QA task applied on 
SQuAD 1.1 and 2.0 datasets. We tested five models, RoBERTa, ALBERT, BERT, XLMRoBERTa, and DistilBERT, and our experiments showed that RoBERTa-base pre-trained model 
has the best performance in terms of F1 and EM scores. 
Moreover, we examined the effect of training steps and training size on these modelsâ€™ performance. 
We found that fine-tuning these models just for 2 epochs is enough to get our reported performance.
